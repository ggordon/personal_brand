  %h2 about me...
  %p 
    I'm a web application developer that's been focusing on Ruby on Rails for the last 3+ years.

  %h2 about the site...
  
  %p 
    This is just a simple blog (not that I have much to say) and portfolio site. Written in 
    Ruby on Rails, the source is freely available to examine or modify on 
    =link_to "github.", "http://github.com/ggordon/personal_brand/tree/master"  

  %h3 setup
  
  %ul
    %li Rails, of course, I'm using the current latest, 2.3.4
    %li a database, create and configure 'config/database.yml' with the database information. (I'm planning on deploying with Heroku, they use PostgreSQL 8.3.5)
    %li
      gems- 
      .code rake gems:install
      will install haml and compass, in the unlikely event you're not already using them.
      
    %li 
      admin username and password are stored in environment variables, didn't think it wise to store that on github.
      .code export PB_USERNAME=admin
      .code export PB_PASSWORD=password
      to deploy on heroku
      .code heroku config:add PB_USERNAME=admin PB_PASSWORD=password
      
        

  %h3 testing
  %ol
    %li
      using test-unit, shoulda, cucumber, metrics_fu
      .code rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
      will install the gems test-unit, mocha, thoughtbot-shoulda, cucumber, webrat, thoughtbot-factory_girl
    %li
      running tests
      .code rake test:all
      .code rake metrics:all
